        <p>There is a hilton on the Syon Park property, which we advise that you stay at on Monday night. You can follow <a href="http://eventsathilton.com/show/5a0c4288ea6f1575c6e608e8">this link</a> to get 15% off of the current room rate. If you have a different discount code you'd like to use (such as the Hilton Honors points or a AAA rate), just be sure to put "Morcos/Caine Wedding" in the comments section for your booking.</p>
        <p>We suggest that you stay in Central London for the rest of your visit, as the Syon Park Hilton is pretty far out of the way from main sightseeing attractions.
        </p>
        <p>The hotel has guaranteed check-in at 3 pm, although they have said they will do their best to allow everyone in our party to check in by 2 pm. It is a five-minute walk door-to-door from the hotel to the venue, so you should be able to drop off your luggage and get ready at the hotel before the wedding begins.</p>

    <h2>How to get there</h2>
    <img class="image2" src="https://imgur.com/vW9x5rL.png">
      <p>To get to Syon Park on public transport, take the Picadilly line towards Heathrow and get off at Boston Manor Station. As you exit the station, go to the bus stop right in front of you (stop N) and take bus E8 to Syon Lane (stop W). Walk down the narrow brick-lined road to the entrance of Syon Park.</p>
      <p>You can also take a cab or an uber, which should be around Â£30.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that the tube closes at midnight on weekdays, so factor that in to your plans if you have to get back to Central London after the wedding.</p>

    <h2>Recommended Airlines</h2>

    <h3>Read on if you want waaaaaaay too much information about booking your flights</h3>
      <p>At this point, we (Ari and Julia) have flown back and forth to the States a number of times. Our favorite airline is Virgin Atlantic. In our experience, it was possible to get a round-trip ticket from NYC to London for $500 (I think it was closer to $700 from Boston), as long as we bought it three months in advance. They provide meals and drinks on board, allow a checked bag, and the seats recline a fair amount. (Unfortunately, we have not been paid by Virgin to promote them!)</p>

      <p>If you are looking for a cheaper option, we suggest Norwegian Air. They frequently have round-trip tickets for under $400 to the East Coast. They are our favorite budget airline - meaning that they don't provide meals or drinks (besides water), no checked bag, the seats recline very little, and there is less legroom. But the planes are all new Boeing 737 or 787s, and they have pretty good entertainment on board.</p>
