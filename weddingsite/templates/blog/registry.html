      <p>If you would like to give a gift, we are registered at amazon.co.uk and johnlewis.com. The John Lewis registry will open up three months before the wedding date. If you decided to give a donation to a charity in our name, please don't get us a physical gift!</p>

<p>Please note that Amazon UK and Amazon US are two different companies. Gift cards to one cannot be applied to the other. Amazon UK charges in pounds, so if you wish to buy from them, make sure you have a credit card that does not charge foreign exchange fees, and then check out in pounds through Amazon (not dollars!).</p>
